_Things I learn/forget over time._

### Java
- Project with lots of modules - No matter [how hard you try to make an import work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26952078/intellij-cannot-resolve-symbol-on-import), if the module where you trying to import from is not defined as a dependency of your module (in your pom.xml), the import will not work.

### GitHub
- [GitHub doesn't support files larger than 100MB by default](https://toubou91.github.io/how-to-push-large-files-to-github/)
